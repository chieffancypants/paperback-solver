# Paperback Solver
A simple app to provide word options for the card game [Paperback](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141572/paperback).

Cheating is ~~never~~ rarely fun, but every once in a while I can't help but wonder if there was a better option.

The [word list](https://github.com/chieffancypants/paperback-solver/blob/main/public/wordlist.txt) ([originally found here](https://norvig.com/ngrams/)) comes from an official scrabble tournament [found here](https://norvig.com/ngrams/) which seems quite thorough and complete, and didn't seem to contain too many proper nouns, abbreviations, or other non-words.
